# aoi-brawlapi
This repository contains a template for creating bots using the Aoi.js library with integration to the Brawl Stars API. The goal of this template is to provide a solid and easy-to-use foundation for developers looking to build custom bots that interact with Brawl Stars data, such as player statistics and match information.

## Setup
If you'd like to create a new project based on this one, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ladyneo/aoi-brawlapi.git
cd aoi-brawlapi
npm install
```
This will clone the repository, creating a new directory, and installing the aoi.js dependency.
