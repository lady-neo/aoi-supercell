# aoi-brawlapi
This repository contains a template for creating bots using the Aoi.js library with integration to the Brawl Stars API. The goal of this template is to provide a solid and easy-to-use foundation for developers looking to build custom bots that interact with Brawl Stars data, such as player statistics and match information.
